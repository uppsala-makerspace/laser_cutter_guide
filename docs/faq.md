# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why is the guide in English only?

Because that is what we decided to do first.

[It is planned to make the manual bilingual](https://github.com/uppsala-makerspace/laser_cutter_guide/issues/1).

## Why is the guide for only one laser cutter

Because that is what we decided to do first.

[It is planned to make the manual for both laser cutters](https://github.com/uppsala-makerspace/laser_cutter_guide/issues/9).
