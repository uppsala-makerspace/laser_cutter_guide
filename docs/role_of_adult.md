# Role of the adult supervisor

For minors, to operate the laser safely, they always need to operature in duos.
They are trained to check each other and prevent accidents.

However, they are still children. Hence, parents have requested
to have an adult supervisor present at all times when minors operator
the laser.

The role of the adult supervisor is:
**to assure that the children remain serious**.

Thanks for you help, also on behalf of the learners!
