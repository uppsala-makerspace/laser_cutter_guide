# 6. Be a good operator

To use the laser, two people are needed:

- Operator: the person that starts the laser
- Controller: the person that double-checks the operator

Both roles are needed to work with a laser safely.

In this lesson, we practice being a good operator.

- Find a controller to work with you
- Read the procedure for the operator

**In this session, we never start the laser**.
All you will say is 'Laser is on'.

## Exercise 1: test the controller

- Take off your glasses
- Let the operator start the procedure
- During countdown, say 'stop'
- However, in step 3, the operator must stop the procedure.
- The controller (not you!) fails if the laser would have been started

## Exercise 2: test the operator

- The controller takes off his/her glasses
- Let the operator start the procedure
- In step 3, stop the procedure
- You pass if you stopped the procedure in step 3
- The controller (not you!) fails if the laser would have been started

## Exercise 3: test the controller again

- Turn off the air flow
- Start the procedure
- During countdown, say 'stop'
- However, in step 1, the operator must say 'stop' to stop the procedure
- The operator (not you!) fails if the laser would have been started

## Exam

Do the following 5 times:

- A certified operator tells the controller secretly to:
    - Do the right thing
    - Put off glasses
- A certified operator tells the operator secretly to:
    - Do the right thing
    - Put off glasses
    - Turn off the air flow
- Do the procedure
- If the laser is turned on when it should not,
  the exam is failed
