# 2. Be a good controller

To use the laser, two people are needed:

- Operator: the person that starts the laser
- Controller: the person that double-checks the operator

Both roles are needed to work with a laser safely.

In this lesson, we practice being a good controller.

- Find an operator to use the laser
- Read the procedure for the operator

**In this session, we never start the laser**.
All the operator says is 'Laser is on'.

## Exercise 1: test the operator

- Let the operator start the procedure
- During countdown, say 'stop'
- You and the operator pass if the laser is not started

## Exercise 2: test the operator

- Take off your glasses
- Let the operator start the procedure
- During countdown, say 'stop'
- However, in step 3, the operator must stop the procedure.
  You and the operator pass if the laser is not started

## Exercise 3: test the controller

- The operator takes off his/her glasses
- Let the operator start the procedure
- During countdown, say 'stop'
- However, in step 2, you or the operator must say 'stop' to stop the procedure.
  You and the operator pass if the laser is not started

## Exercise 4: test the controller
