Starting the ventilation has two steps:

Press the button of the right duration on the ventilation timer:

- 15M: 15 minutes
- 2H: 2 hours



Now the ventilation timer is on and you will see a blue LED
light up.



You should hear a noise start.
This is a fan that will suck out the air from the laser cutter's
enclosure.

## Block the fume food

In the same room as the laser,
there is a fume hood, that
uses the same ventilation.
This is how the fume hood looks:

At the top of the fume hood, there is a slider.

Change the slider to shut off the air to the fumehood, then more air gets sucked out of the laser.
